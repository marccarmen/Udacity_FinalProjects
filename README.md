Udacity_FinalProjects
=====================
I have been working on a variety of Udacity courses but so far I haven't paid for any of them.  If you don't pay for the courses you don't get the certificate of completion.  So I am putting the final projects I finish into this repository.  Each class will have a folder with the final project details.

So far I have started a lot of courses but only finished a CS 101 Intro to Computer Science and UD 617 Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce.  However, I don't have the code for UD 617 any longer so I have not uploaded that yet.
